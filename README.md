# VideoTime
##
 A personal C# program, that tells how long the total duration of videos in a folder.

## Usage:
As of right now the only usage of this is with hardcoded strings, my next step will be a small gui where you can browse for a folder location.

## Roadmap
- [x] By providing a file path, the program will return the total amount of video duration.
- [x] Add a Graphical User Interface.
